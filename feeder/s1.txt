--
Keynote By Jason Schenker.
[00:00] Good morning everyone. It's a pleasure to be here discussing the future of financial services in an era of rapid transformation.
[02:02] Economic volatility has become the norm, not the exception. Institutions must build resilience into their core operations.
[04:04] AI is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. Predictive analytics are helping firms anticipate market shifts before they happen.
[06:06] Geopolitical risk is now a boardroom topic. From sanctions to trade wars, financial institutions must be agile and informed.
[08:08] We’re seeing a convergence of technology and economics. AI models are now integral to macroeconomic forecasting.
[10:10] Digital transformation must be holistic. It’s not just about adopting tools—it’s about reshaping culture and strategy.
[12:12] Financial services must embrace modularity. Systems should be flexible enough to adapt to regulatory and market changes.
[14:14] Cybersecurity is paramount. As AI systems grow, so does the attack surface. Institutions must invest in robust defenses.
[16:16] Talent is a key differentiator. Upskilling teams to work alongside AI is critical for long-term success.
[18:18] We’re entering an age of intelligent automation. From underwriting to compliance, AI is streamlining operations.
[20:20] Data governance is foundational. Without clean, traceable data, AI outputs are unreliable and risky.
[22:22] Scenario planning is evolving. Digital twins of enterprises allow us to simulate economic shocks and test resilience.
[24:24] Cross-border finance is being reshaped by AI. Risk profiling and transaction monitoring are becoming more sophisticated.
[26:26] The future belongs to adaptive enterprises. Those who can pivot quickly will thrive amid uncertainty.
[28:28] Thank you for your attention. I look forward to the panel discussions and hearing diverse perspectives on these challenges.
